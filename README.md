# AE-ProfileEditor
A multi-use profile editor written in .NET for Altered Escape of JET.

Developed by hazelify as part of the JET / AE project. Designed to help fellow singleplayer gamers manage their singleplayer profiles and configs easily.

# Info
SYNAPSE is an AE exclusive app that allows the user to manage all profiles within any of their AE servers with ease. It also comes with a bot editor to alter AI categories.

**This app is a WIP, and things may break.**

# Extracting and opening
Please install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) for extracting zipped folders, as WinRAR sometimes doesn't work.

Unpack `AE-ProfileEditor-main.zip` to somewhere you remember.

Right click -> `7zip` -> `Extract here` -> Drag and drop the folder `SYNAPSE` into any folder. Make sure you remember the path.

Open `SYNAPSE.exe` and you're good to go!

# Customizing / using
Upon opening the app, if not already present, `backups` folder, `SYNAPSE.log` and `config.txt` will be created.

`backups` folder is where generated profile backups go when you import an AE profile.

`SYNAPSE.log` is where actions get logged when using the app.

`config.txt` holds your configuration settings, server path and default profile to edit. More options may be implemented in the future.
